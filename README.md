## AVR Makefile Template

This is a template for making a makefile for avr development. A generation script was also added to make it more convenient, it can be put in the PATH so it can be called anytime. It should work on linux all fine assuming you have all the programs it needs. If you are on windows, MINGW should run the shell script without any furthur modifications.

You are free to modify it to your liking though if there are any improvements that you made, try submitting a pull-request :3
